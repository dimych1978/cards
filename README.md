This program allows you to play a memory training game: after 5 seconds, restore the location of a pair of open cards.
The game has 3 difficulty levels: 6, 12 and 18 cards (respectively, 3, 6 and 9 pairs).
In the case of an erroneously opened card, the game ends with the assignment of defeat to the player.
The winner is the player who opens all pairs of cards at the corresponding difficulty level.
